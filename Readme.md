# Data Science Application

This application allows users to upload datasets, explore them, preprocess the data, and build machine learning or deep learning models. The app provides a simple and interactive interface for performing tasks like exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and result visualization.

## **Flow of the Application**

1. **Upload Dataset**  
   Users upload a dataset in **CSV** or **JSON** format.

2. **Data Validation**  
   The app validates and summarizes the data to ensure it's clean and ready for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Users can explore the dataset through:

   - Summary statistics
   - Visualizations
   - Analysis of distributions, trends, and correlations.

4. **Preprocessing**  
   Users can apply necessary transformations such as:

   - Scaling
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering (if required).

5. **Results Visualization**  
   The app visualizes the performance of the trained model and its predictions.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**:

  - **Python**
  - Libraries:
    - Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)
    - Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (Machine Learning & Deep Learning)
    - Seaborn, Matplotlib (Data visualization)

- **Frontend**:

  - **Streamlit** (for an interactive dashboard)

- **Testing**:

  - **pytest** for unit and integration tests.

- **Data**:
  - Supported formats: **CSV** and **JSON** files (no external databases used for simplicity).

## **How to Use**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Launch the application via Streamlit. cd into app and then run `streamlit run app.py`
4. Upload your dataset and explore it through the interface.
5. Apply transformations, train models, and visualize results.
